record gif from terminal output:

I used a utility called ffcast, see here or here. To create the gif, I also needed to have byzanz-record installed. Then I used sleep 3; ffcast byzanz-record -- cast.gif to capture the entire full screen. The sleep part was to be able to switch the windows so that I only captured the full screen vim session.
