Window management is configured in touchpad system settings and via [Better Touch Tool BTT](https://folivora.ai), see [here](https://medium.com/@arpitpalod/i-am-so-in-love-with-my-mac-trackpad-c3bbcecef41d) for introduction and some ideas.

All gestures which look too hard to learn easly are left out. All settings below starting with `BTT` are done in Better Touch Tool, mostly in Trackpad and Keyboard settings.

Hint: When adusting trackpad actions, watch grey rectangular mini-display how the gesture is supposed to look like.

General idea:
* 3Finger Swipes and Command-Key-Combinations act on applications, tabs, windows
* 4Finger Swipes and Control-Key-Combinations act on spaces and mission control
* 5Finger Swipes act on mac os system
* left-right movements and arrows switch tabs, windows and spaces
* up/down movements open/close something
* up is fullscreen, down restores size
* 3Finger tap and double tap is reserved for application-specific setup
