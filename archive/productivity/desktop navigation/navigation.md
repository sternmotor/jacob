* ThumbUp, ThumbDown: Thumb button pointing away from/towards you
* WheelUp, WheelDown: Wheel scrolling away from/towards you

Other actions are
* pulling window in screen Edge
* turning wheel when mouse hovers over desktop (no window)


Tabs: Thumb buttons
Spaces: Wheel left/right

## Why this?

When working on mutiple operating systems (Apple, Windows, Linux) and with some different applications
is may be advantageous to find a way how to make the navigation as similar and easy as possible.

This text contains shortcuts for navigating between panels, windows, tabs - boiled down
from multiple applications's and environments approaches. The challenge was to keep
common standards and to avoid interference of e.g. keyboard shortcut definitions.

This is a concept, only. For different OS, the implementation has to be done via tools like BetterTouchTool or Xorg scripts. This guide has a strong emphasis on *working* with a desktop system, based on keyboard-only usage or strong keyboard modifier support for mouse actions.

## Terms
Definitions used here:


## Modifiers
Modifier keys (like SHIFT, ALT, CTRL, CMD/WIN) are used for both keyboard and mouse actions as follows:

Modifiers are written like `CTRL + LM`. Fluxbox and macos support sequences of key combinations which are written like `CTRL + ESC > CTRL + k`.

* SHIFT:
* CTRL: control key
* ALT: option key under mac os, Windows AltGR is ignored here
* CMD: command key on macos keyboards
* WIN: windows key on x86 keyboards
