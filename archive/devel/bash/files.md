# Bash scripting - file handling


Prepare regular ini file for bash parsing via `source`or `.` operator: remove comments, delete empty lines, combine spaces etc.:

    sed -e '/^$/d;s/^[ \t]*//;s/[ \t]*$//;/^$/d;s/[ \t]\#.*//' \
    -e 's/^#$//;s/^\#[^!].*//;/^$/d' \
    -e 's/[ \t]\+/ /g' \
    -e 's/[ \t]*=[ \t]*/=/' $CONFIG_PATH

File tests

      -a FILE        True if file exists.
      -b FILE        True if file is block special.
      -c FILE        True if file is character special.
      -d FILE        True if file is a directory.
      -e FILE        True if file exists.
      -f FILE        True if file exists and is a regular file.
      -g FILE        True if file is set-group-id.
      -h FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.
      -L FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.
      -k FILE        True if file has its `sticky' bit set.
      -p FILE        True if file is a named pipe.
      -r FILE        True if file is readable by you.
      -s FILE        True if file exists and is not empty.
      -S FILE        True if file is a socket.
      -t FD          True if FD is opened on a terminal.
      -u FILE        True if the file is set-user-id.
      -w FILE        True if the file is writable by you.
      -x FILE        True if the file is executable by you.
      -O FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by you.
      -G FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by your group.
      -N FILE        True if the file has been modified since it was last read.
 
      FILE1 -nt FILE2  True if file1 is newer than file2 (according to
                       modification date).
 
      FILE1 -ot FILE2  True if file1 is older than file2.
 
      FILE1 -ef FILE2  True if file1 is a hard link to file2.
