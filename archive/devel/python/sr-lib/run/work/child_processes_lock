"""
  Description:
    This script automate system backups thanks to rdiff-backup and rsync. It
    is based on an idea from the "Backup up on unreliable link" article
    ( http://wiki.rdiff-backup.org/wiki/index.php/BackupUpOnUnreliableLink )
    published on the official rdiff-backup wiki ( http://wiki.rdiff-backup.org ).

  Last update: 2007 dec 24

  Requirements:
    * linux
    * python >= 2.4
    * rdiff-backup >= 1.1.0
    * rsync >= 2.6.7
    * ssh
    * ps

  Features:
    * Use rsync to make a local mirror of the remote machine (to speed-up backups and make them working over unreliable connection)
    * Auto-clean rdiff-backup repository
    * Lock mechanism to not run this script twice
    * Auto-kill the script if the backup process take to much time
    * New increment will not be created if rsync didn't reached the remote host

  Advices:
    * Run this script regularly via to a cron entry, e.g.: `0 13 * * * root /root/system-backup.py >> /mnt/backup-disk/backup.log`
    * Modify BACKUP_TIMEOUT constant according your cron job frequency
    * Use rsa-key/certificate-based authentication to access remote machine via SSH

  TODO:
    * nice -n 19 (do not take all ressources) ?
    * use logger module instead of printing in the wild...
    * How can I do to not run command in shell ? is it make sense ?
    * auto kill after XX hours of running (use a timer).
