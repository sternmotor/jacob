I would say that its as simple that backups that isn't tested regularly is worthless.

A my previous job we had a policy that every system (production, test, development monitoring etc.) should be test restored every 6 months.

This was also the job of the most junior admin so that documentation was up to date. Junior being defined by how much work he/she had don on the specific system, sometime (quite often actually) it was the "group manager" that did it

We had special hardware dedicated to this (one Intel and one IBM/AIX box) that was low spec for everything but diskspace, since we did not need to run anything real on the restored host.

Quite a lot of work the first couple of rounds but it led us to streamline the restore process which is the important part of backup.
