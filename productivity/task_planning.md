Google for decoration guidelines. To get a grip on task lists, note taking and calendar this simple approach works, too:

* Take a blank book, page numbers and grid are essential
* Settle down tag categories for your topics, examples for private topics:
    * I = important, howtos
    * D = diary
    * R = cooking recipies
    * P = photography
    * J = joke
    * M = movie recommendations
    * B = books to read
    * H = household planning
    * S = Sports
* Set up a table of contents where page numbers point to tagged notes or topic-specific collection pages at the end of the note book
* Have one "sometime" page where tasks and ideas for the next 2 years up to much more  are noted 
* Set up a calendar where postphoned tasks and appointments are noted, 3 months per page
* For every three months' calendar space, leave a page for tasks which do not have a fixed due day (future planning, quarterly transfer)
* Start your notes and dayly task list by marking today's date and writing down task, appointments and notes
* Write your open, done or postphoned tasks in this dayly list, maximum 1-3 important items a day, maximum 2-5 words per task
    * `.`           = task for today
    * `O`           = appointment today
    * `V`           = task finished (override `.`)
    * `>`           = task shiftet to tomorrow (override `.`)
    * `DATE <`      = task postphoned to other date (override `.`)
    * `X`           = task declined (override `.`)
    * `DATE O TIME` = appointment on other day, marked in calendar   
    * `! .`         = very very important task today
* Plan your day every morning: check calendar pages for appointments and planned tasks for today, check yesterday for unfinished tasks and put down your task list for today, postphone what is more than you can handle today
* When postphoning tasks or marking appointments in calendar, write the page number on the corresponding day an surround the page number
    * with a square for a task
    * with a circle for an appointment
    * with a candle for birthday 
* Write concepts and bigger notes on the next free page, mark them by category tag and note their page number under tag category in a table of contents 
* Refer to other pages by putting down page number surrounded by square
* On the last pages of your notebooks, collect ideas or picked up recommendations for topics which are likely to fit on a page in sum, mark this page in table of contents. Examples: 
    * gift ideas
    * travel targets
    * books to read
